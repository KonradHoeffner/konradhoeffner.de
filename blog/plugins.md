# Tools, Addons and Settings for efficient work

* [XKCD Is it worth the time?](https://xkcd.com/1205/)

## The mouse is radioactive

## Keyboard
Learn what the keys do:

* Pos1
* End
* CTRL+Left
+ CTRL+Right
* Page Up
* Page Down

## Hotkeys for frequent tools

Identify the most common applications and assign them hotkeys.
For me, those are CTRL+ALT+Letter, for example:

M - Mail client
T - Terminal
I - Internet browser
J - Java IDE

## ChatGPT Custom Instructions

In its baseline setting, ChatGPT wastes too much space with formalities and apologizing.
It also often doesn't give you a clear answer between two alternatives but instead says that both are great and gives you a list of pros and cons.
However I prefer an opinionated short answer, so I have the following settings:

### Custom instructions -> How would you like ChatGPT to respond

> Keep your answer as short, informal as possible. You also don't need to apologize or thank me.
> When I ask you programming questions, I want short code and I don't care about backwards compatibility, I target the newest browser and so on. However when it isn't a programming question don't give me code.
> When I ask you for advice, please be opinionated and give me the one you think is best, if there are alternatives, just list them quickly with like one major advantage and disadvantage.

## Browser Addons

* Adblocker: uBlock origin
* I don't care about cookies
* Binnen-I be gone

## Thunderbird Quicktext

Do you waste time agonizing about which greeting and farewell formulas you use with which person and then typing the same words again and again?
Quicktext solves both problems by letting you define templates for different languages, genders and formality levels.
I use the hotkeys Alt+1..5 to each template, which immediately places the cursor at the correct spot for me to start typing.
