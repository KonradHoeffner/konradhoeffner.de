# Finishing Your PhD Thesis&mdash;Formal Requirements at FMI Leipzig
The formalities are detailed at the [FMI "Promotionen" Page](https://www.fmi.uni-leipzig.de/cms/de/forschung/promotionen/), mostly in the "Promotionsordnung", but they are quite detailed and require a number of different documents.
I'm very thankful to Nathanael Arndt, Thomas Pause and indirectly Nicolas Wieseke for helping me and for scripts and templates, which I compiled below to help others save time and nerves.

## Finding Referees
In addition to your supervisor, you need to find three potential referees for your PhD thesis, and you should do this well in advance of your submission because it may take a while to find and contact them.
At least one of them needs to be Professor at a university, the others may also be Junior Professor, Professor at a "Fachhochschule" (a university of applied science) or have an habilitation equivalent.
At least one of them also needs to be teaching at the FMI Leipzig, else you need to ask a FMI Professor if you can schedule a meeting to present your thesis and get and endorsement ("Bef√ºrwortung der Einreichung der Dissertation").
At the end, two of the referees get chosen.

## Submission Checklist
